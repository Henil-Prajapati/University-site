			It would not be wrong to say that the FoT is the crown jewel of DDU. In fact, DDU primarily started as an engineering college (called DDIT) offering degree and diploma in Chemical Engineering in 1968. Since then, it has come a long way - adding other branches of engineering and postgraduate courses, becoming autonomous in 1990 and a deemed university in 2000, and subsequently turning into a University in 2005.
